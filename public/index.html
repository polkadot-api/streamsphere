        We specialize in creating tools for blockchain technology, emphasizing a "light-client first" approach. Our
        expertise includes real-time data handling, showcased by Víctor's success in launching trading platforms with
        substantial monthly volumes and Josep's excellence as the lead developer on a plethora of influential
        open-source libraries. We aim to provide modular libraries, optimize DApp performances, and equip our users and
        clients with elite tools to navigate the world of data.

        <h2><span>The Team</span></h2>
        <h3>Josep M Sobrepere</h3>
        <p> Josep, a key contributor at Parity Technologies since September 2021, played a vital role in projects like
            @substrate/connect, Polkadot-API, and more. As the architect of Polkadot-API, he transformed
            @substrate/connect into the first Polkadot Provider compliant extension. Beyond Parity, he co-authored the
            React-RxJS project with Victor Oliva and contributed to prominent open-source libraries, including RxJS,
            React-Router, React-Redux, and Reselect.
        </p>

        <h3> Victor Oliva</h3>
        <p>
            Víctor, a seasoned software developer specializing in real-time data, has been a consultant since 2016, with
            a focus on building trading platforms. Collaborating with Josep, he co-authored React-RxJS, using it as the
            primary state management library to successfully launch two trading platforms. One platform achieved a
            monthly volume of 12 billion USD with around 3500 filled orders per day. Víctor has also made significant
            contributions to various open-source projects, including RxJS, chai, SockJS, webpack, and fakehost. His
            diverse side projects range from exploring alternative approaches to handling decimal numbers to developing
            a rollup plugin for Polkadot-API.

        <h3>Polkadot-API:</h3>
        <p>Polkadot-API aims to surpass PolkadotJs by offering meticulously crafted, composable libraries aligned with a
            "light-client first" philosophy. It empowers decentralized app developers, enhancing the overall developer
            experience and setting a new standard for efficiency, adaptability, and performance in the Polkadot
            ecosystem.</p>
